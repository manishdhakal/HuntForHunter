# HuntForHunter
## Curriculum project for Object Oriented Programming in C++

Library Used : OpenGL 4.6, SDL 2.0 and glm 0.9.9.3

IDE Used : Visual Stduio 2017 32-bit


Instructions for Compiling:

- Open Game.sln file.
- Click on the local windows debugger in the Visual Studio.
- Error occurs as the executable file cannot find "sdl2.dll" library.
- A "bin" named file will be automatically created in the same main directory.
- Follow the directory "bin/HuntForHunter/x64/Debug" and paste the "sdl2.dll" from the SDL dependency.
- Now the program runs without errors.


The necessary files required for the executable file to run directly outside the IDE are:

- Levels
- score
- textures
- shaders

	PS:All of these files are available in the "Hunt For Hunter" directory.
